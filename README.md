Module 3 Challenge
This is to be the compiled work of my Week 3 Challenge using
Python along with GitHub and GitBash. Thanks for stopping in.
This work was mostly constructed by myself, however I did have help with parts of it. That specific recognition goes to ChatGPT AI Module 3.5, and more 
importantly to my step-dad the in-house Guru and cheif IT director of the family business W.I.T.S., Dan Harper.
Also, line 37 in the main.py for PyPoll is not a typo, we couldn't help but have a little fun.
